### This is a repository for an article on [our Blog](https://www.bluesoft.cz/en/blog) about the [integration of Hangfire in Xperience by Kentico](https://www.bluesoft.cz/en/blog/missing-scheduletasks-in-xperience-by-kentico).

üõ†Ô∏è Looking for a solid stand-in for Kentico‚Äôs Scheduled Task module?

Kentico's Scheduled Task module has been a key tool for developers managing automated tasks and recurring operations. However, it is not part of [Xperience by Kentico](https://www.kentico.com/) just yet.

No worries, though! Open-source tools like [Hangfire](https://www.hangfire.io/) step in perfectly to fill that gap. Follow the steps in our article for a smooth integration or go off this repository.
